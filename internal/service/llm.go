// Why an answer down the model path is degraded. They are declared reasons and
// they travel in the answer, because a poor result with a provider that failed
// and one with a provider that answered nonsense are fixed in different ways.
// retriesOnSQLFailure is how many extra attempts a failed query buys.
//
// One, and the number is the whole design. Measured against real qwen3.5:4b the
// first SQL is often invalid in a way the engine describes exactly ("no such
// column: source_agent", "misuse of aggregate: MAX()"), and a model that is
// shown that error usually fixes it at once. A model that does not fix it with
// the error in front of it will not fix it on the fifth try either, and every
// try costs seconds of the operator's time.
const retriesOnSQLFailure = 1

// failure: the engine's own verdict and the order to answer with SQL again.

// llmStage is stage 4 of the cascade, with stage 5 behind it.
//
// The order of what happens here is the contract and not an implementation
// detail:
//
//  1. A provider is chosen by availability. What is not available does not get
//     asked, and why it was not is recorded. In the factory order only, a local
//     CLI whose first real request disproves its session fails forward.
//  2. The model generates SQL and that SQL ALWAYS goes through the SQLite-backed
//     read-only gate. A model is not above the gate: if it were, "everything
//     that runs has been validated" would stop being true.
//  3. Whatever fails from here on degrades to the keyword rescue instead of
//     failing, and it says which of the declared things went wrong. The
//     fragility of a provider never takes down a query. An explicit refusal is
//     not one of them: the model answered, so the question ends there and no
//     rescue searches for rows the model already said are out of scope.
//
// Configured orders never retry a provider failure with the next provider. The
// factory local-CLI exception is declared in the attempts and applies only to
// the first request, before any SQL answer exists.

// withResidentMemorySearch merges the bundled data halves into a core answer that
// already succeeded. A half that cannot be read is a warning and not a failure:
// the rest of the plugin path skips what it cannot use, and a merged search that
// answers nothing where the unmerged one answered is the worse of the two.

// limitMergedSearchRows makes core and operational history compete under one
// recency order before applying the shared limit. Appending one database behind
// the other and then truncating would make source order decide recall.

// declaredSearchSQL reports both halves of the merged answer. Declaring the core
// statement alone would hand the operator SQL that returns strictly fewer rows
// than the answer it is supposed to explain.

// rescueSQL compiles the deterministic literal fallback without executing it.
// SQL-only is an inspection boundary: provider selection and the gate may run,
// but the operator's database must not be queried for result rows.
