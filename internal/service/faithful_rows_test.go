// The model path returns what the SQL returned.
//
// A query is the question going to the model, the model's SQL going to the
// database and ITS rows coming back. The answer prints that SQL beside the rows,
// so a presentation layer that deduplicates, reorders or drops rows makes the
// printed SQL stop describing what it is printed next to. From the v1 model-only
// decision: no silent filters, and an honest zero.
//
// The cross join asks for each of the three seeded memories three times, so the
// statement's own result set is nine rows of which LIMIT keeps eight, every id
// repeated and ordered by id. Collapsing that to three distinct rows is the
// silent filter this pins shut.
