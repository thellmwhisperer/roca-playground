// Package provider is the model adapters and the cascade that chooses between
// them.
//
// With no explicit order, the decision is detected local agent CLIs in stable
// preset order, then Ollama as the local floor. An environment or file order is
// preserved as the operator wrote it; keyword rescue belongs to the service
// after this provider cascade rather than pretending to be a provider.
//
// Three things this package holds on to, and each one was paid for:
//
//   - **The fall is normally by availability, not by exception.** Before using a
//     provider it is asked Ready. The factory order permits one narrower case:
//     a detected local CLI whose first real request disproves its usable session
//     fails forward without paying for a separate inference probe.
//   - **The provenance travels in the type.** A Selection carries where the
//     order came from, so a name the operator persisted degrades with a warning
//     and one written in code still fails. There is no way to lose the
//     provenance along the way because there is no constructor without it.
//   - **Zero provider SDKs.** Network adapters speak HTTP with net/http; local
//     adapters run an argv template with os/exec. An SDK puts its dependency
//     chain and version cadence inside the binary to save two hundred lines.
